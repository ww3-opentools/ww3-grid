README FOR smcProps AND plotSMCgrid FUNCTIONS

#-------------------------
USING THE smcProps LIBRARY

PURPOSE

The purpose of this library is to run standalone SMC grid propagation tests.
These are used to diagnose any stability issues with a grid prior to deployment
in WAVEWATCH III


RUNNING THE CODE

Before running the code, 'smcProps.f90' needs to be built using the
make_smcProps.sh (or other local) bash script

The smcProps executable is then run using the bash script 'run_smcProps.sh':

./run_genSides.sh WORKINGDIRECTORYPATH

where WORKINGDIRECTORYPATH is the path to a directory containing the 'ww3Cels.dat'
('ww3ArcCels.dat') 'ww3GISide.dat', 'ww3GJSide.dat' ('ww3AISide.dat', 
'ww3GAJSide.dat') and 'smcGrid.nml' ('arcGrid.nml') files generated using the
gridgen functions. The .nml namelists provide the necessary control information
for the propagation tests and can be adapted if needed (e.g. different input 
Cels.dat filename).


#-------------------------
USING THE plotSMCgrid LIBRARY

PURPOSE

The purpose of this library is to plot the generated grid and results of 
propagation tests.

RUNNING THE CODE

Two functions are available, 'run_plotSMCGrid.py' and 'run_plotSMCprops.py'
which, respectively, plot the model grid and results of the propagation tests.
Both are run from the command line using:

python run_plotSMCGrid.py MODELNAME WORKINGDIRECTORYPATH

python run_plotSMCprops.py MODELNAME WORKINGDIRECTORYPATH

where WORKINGDIRECTORYPATH is the path to a directory containing the 'ww3Cels.dat'
('ww3ArcCels.dat') and 'smcGrid.nml' ('arcGrid.nml') files generated using the
gridgen functions. The .nml namelists provide the necessary control information
for the plotting and can be adapted if needed (e.g. different input 
Cels.dat filename). In addition to the namelist and cell files,'run_plotSMCprops.py'
also expects plotting information for the grid (pre-generated by running 
'run_plotSMCGrid.py') to exist in a file named:

WORKINGDIRECTORYPATH/MODELNAME_VrtsAREA.npz

where AREA is ['Glob','Euro','Paci','Atla'] dependent on the grid area chosen for
plotting.
